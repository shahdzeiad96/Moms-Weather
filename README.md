"# Moms-Weather" A smart weather app to help moms dress their kids appropriately

👩‍👧 Overview

WeatherWise Kids is a kid-friendly weather app designed especially for moms. The app goes beyond showing the forecast — it offers personalized clothing recommendations to help dress children comfortably and safely for the day’s conditions.
